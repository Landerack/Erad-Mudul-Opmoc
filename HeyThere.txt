Hi, this is the dev~

entry 1:

Great start here, Decided to just do a little bit of scene dressing. yknow basic shapes and all that. Looking pretty nice. Will soon be able to animate a character, a particle and wup~ some walking. then make sure that flame doesnt die (or does. yknow)

Entry 2:

The power. the 2d pipeline renderer. Only once every 100 years can a unity user experience such immense fire.
