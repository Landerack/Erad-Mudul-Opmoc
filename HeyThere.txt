Hi, this is the dev log~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
entry 1: Form the world

Great start here, Decided to just do a little bit of scene dressing. yknow basic shapes and all that. Looking pretty nice. Will soon be able to animate a character, a particle and wup~ some walking. then make sure that flame doesnt die (or does. yknow)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 2: Pipeline setup

The power. the 2d pipeline renderer. Only once every 100 years can a unity user experience such immense fire.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 3: Fix_Rendering+VolumeSetup

Pfew. first hurdle overcome. turns out I had the wrong material on a sprite. But luckily it's getting there~ Took a bit, but things are looking pretty.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 4: Particles.

The little lights. Ever do their hearts beat~ before they are snuffed out!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 5: player world collision.

I felt my feet on the cold cobblestone today. I feel box like. almost as if I am a placeholder.. What is this place?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 6: player Movement with Placeholder.

I stepped forward, why do I feel nothing? I seem so unlike myself.. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 7: player Animation sketch (walk).

Everything pulls.. I move and I feel my joints ache. I run and.. It's.. a strange feeling. I cannot run, yet I leap. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entry 8: player Animation sketches Implement.

I feel the movement.. Wait.. I feel.. Pain?
